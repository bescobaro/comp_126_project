            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Who can be deported?</summary>
                    <p>Any person residing in the U.S. who is not a citizen is subject to deportation, including Lawful Permanent Residents and visa holders. Those non-citizens convicted of certain crimes face the highest risk of removal and may also be barred from adjusting their legal status or returning to the country after travel.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Can US Citizens be Deported?</summary>
                    <p>US citizens cannot be deported. Deportation (formal removal from the country) is a process strictly applied to non-citizens.</p>
                    <p>However, a naturalized citizen is subject to a rare legal process called denaturalization. The government can attempt to revoke the citizenship of a naturalized citizen.</p>
                    <p>If a person's citizenship is successfully stripped through denaturalization, they revert to the status of a lawful permanent resident or foreign national and may then become vulnerable to deportation proceedings.</p>
            </details>
